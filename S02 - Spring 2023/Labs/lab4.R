# Hang the spring (narrow end up) from the ring stand. Hang
# a weight holder from the other end of the spring and place
# the range finder on the ground underneath the weight holder.
# You will take data by connecting the range finder to a USB
# interface box and using the Data Studio software. Set the
# experiment up so that you get a three column list where
# the first column is the time data, the second column is the
# position data, the third column is the velocity data. Save
# your data as a "CSV" ("Comma Separated Values") file.  

# Use a plumb to align the weight holder and the range finder.
# In order to get good data, the range finder must always be
# a least 0.5 meters from the weight holder. Put several
# different weights on the mass holder and use the range
# finder to measure the period of oscillation for several
# different masses.
